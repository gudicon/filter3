              An influencer is someone who creates a page on Filter to engage
              with influencers who purchase memberships on Filter App to support
              the influencer’s creations. There are a lot of details below

            To summarise: Influencers keep full ownership of their creations,
            and Filters keep full ownership of what they post on Filter, but
            give us permission to use them as part of Filter’s services. Make
            sure you have permission to post the creations that you make
            available on Filter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Influencers keep full ownership of their creations, and users keep
            full ownership of what they post on Filter, but we need licences
            from you for this material in order to operate Filter’s services
            effectively. By making creations available on Filter or otherwise
            posting on Filter, you grant us a royalty-free, perpetual,
            irrevocable, non-exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license
            covering your creation or what you post in all formats and channels
            now known or later developed anywhere in the world to use, copy,
            reproduce, store, translate, transmit, distribute, perform, prepare
            derivative works, publicly display and display in connection with
            any name, username, voice or likeness provided in connection with
            it. If your creations contain any personal data, you also recognise
            Filter’s “legitimate interest” in it in accordance with the scope of
            this licence.
          </p>
          <p>
            This sounds like a lot, but it’s important for us to operate our
            services, including hosting creations, providing and promoting
            memberships to your fans and enabling community features like post
            comments. For clarity, you keep full ownership over your creations
            and what you post on Filter; we are not buying your intellectual
            property rights or leasing them from you for our gain. We will never
            try to steal your creations, use them in an exploitative way or seek
            to profit off them by any means other than facilitating memberships
            you’ve configured on Filter.
          </p>
          <p>
            You agree not to make available creations or otherwise make posts on
            Filter that infringe others’ intellectual property or proprietary
            rights. Filter reserves the right to remove creations and other
            material that violate Filter’s terms and policies, including these
            Terms of Use and the Community Guidelines. We respond to complaint
            notifications of claimed copyright infringement and have adopted and
            reasonably implemented a policy for terminating, in appropriate
            circumstances, the accounts of creators and Filters who are the
            subject of repeated compliant notifications of claimed copyright
            infringement or other evidence that suggests a pattern of repeat
            infringement. Information regarding how this policy is implemented
            as well as the process for reporting or responding to notifications
            of claimed copyright infringement can be found here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users may not use creations posted by influencers in any way not
            authorised by the influencer, including sharing those creations with
            others who have not purchased the offering or subscription through
            which those creations were made available.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cancelling your membership or lowering the tier support below the
            applicable threshold may result in your loss of access to membership
            subscription benefits, including a creator’s filter-only posts and
            other benefits. You may also lose access to offerings you’ve
            purchased and membership subscription benefits if, for example and
            as applicable, your payment method fails, we terminate your account,
            the creator blocks you, the creator stops making offerings and/or
            memberships available on Filter, the creator deletes their Filter
            account, the creator changes who has access to an offering and/or
            membership, the creator removes a post or offering from their Filter
            account, we remove the creator from Filter, we change who has access
            to an offering and/or membership or we remove a post or offering
            from a creator’s Filter account. We are not required to allow you to
            access an offering, be a filter of, or to otherwise interact with
            any particular creator.
          </p>
          <p>
            Membership subscriptions and offerings vary and we have limited
            control over the quality and specific benefits. We attempt to screen
            for fraudulent creator pages, but cannot guarantee the identity of
            creators or the validity of any claims they make. We appreciate your
            help reporting suspicious creator pages so we can keep the Filter
            community safe.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are located in a jurisdiction in which Filter is required to
            charge and collect tax, for example VAT or sales tax, then this tax
            is added to the total charge. Except in limited circumstances, this
            tax is shown to you when purchasing an offering or starting a paid
            subscription. Filter remits all tax collected to the applicable
            taxing authority. As tax is largely dependent on your location, you
            agree to keep your location complete and up to date in order to
            enable accurate collection of taxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you pay in a currency that is different from the currency
            associated with your payment instrument, then the financial
            institution associated with that payment instrument may charge you a
            foreign transaction fee for that payment. We are not applying this
            fee and have no control over it, have no knowledge of whether the
            fee is applied and do not receive any of the funds from that fee.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if you pay in the same currency as the currency associated with
            your payment instrument, when your payment is processed in a country
            different from the one associated with your payment instrument, then
            the financial institution associated with that payment instrument
            may charge you a foreign transaction fee for that payment. We are
            not applying this fee, have no knowledge of whether the fee is
            applied and do not receive any of the funds from that fee, but our
            choices about payment processing may affect or otherwise give rise
            to this fee.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are constantly experimenting with product features to make Filter
            better and may add, remove or test features with a subset of
            filters. Access to these features is not guaranteed and may not be
            subject to your control. Instead, we may enable and disable these
            early-access, beta or test features at our sole discretion. These
            features may also be subject to additional restrictions and
            limitations, including some that we describe in our Help Centre.
          </p>
          <p>
            Refunds. Our policy is not to provide refunds, including if you lose
            access to offerings and/or membership subscription benefits as
            described above, though we may allow for some exceptions where
            refunds are granted at our sole discretion. If you made a purchase
            on certain platforms (like the App Store), then Filter may not be
            able to address any associated refund requests and you may need to
            contact those platforms directly. You can learn more here.

          <p>Filter&#39;s role</p>
          <p>
            To summarise: We may look at some pages and posts on Filter and
            review reported pages to identify potential violations of these
            terms and our policies.
          </p>
          <p>
            We look at some pages and posts on Filter to enforce these terms and
            our policies, including our Community Guidelines and Benefit
            Guidelines. We also investigate reports of potential violations.
            These investigations may take a while to resolve and, primarily
            because Filter may be exposed to risk based on what is done with
            funds earned on Filter, may include reviewing activity outside of
            Filter.
          </p>
          <p>
            In most situations, we will work with creators and filters to
            resolve any potential policy violations and allow the creator or
            filter to continue using Filter. Filter may terminate creator or
            filter accounts when we believe it is necessary to protect creators,
            filters, Filter or the broader community, but it is not an action we
            take lightly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Filter reserves the right to remove a creator or filter from
            participating in annual memberships. Removing a creator from
            participation in annual memberships will remove the option for
            further filters to purchase annual subscriptions on Filter for that
            creator. Removing a filter from participation in annual memberships
            will prohibit that filter from purchasing further annual
          </p>
          <p>
            membership subscriptions on Filter for any creator. This will not,
            however, result in an automatic removal of the creator or filter
            from Filter, unless there is an independent basis for that removal.
          </p>

            Please let us know if you see potential violations of our Community
            Guidelines. You can learn how to report them here.

            As a global company based in the United States with operations in
            other countries, we must comply with economic sanctions and trade
            restrictions, including those implemented by the Office of Foreign
            Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the United States Department of the

            force. If either party fails to enforce a right provided by these
            terms, then it does not waive the ability to enforce any rights in
            the future.

            We may sometimes make changes to these terms. If we make a change to
            these terms that, in our sole discretion, is material, then we will
            let you know before the changes come into effect. Continuing to use
            Filter after a change means you accept the new terms or policies.
